[SCION](https://github.com/jbeard4/SCION) is an implementation of [SCXML](http://www.w3.org/TR/scxml/) in JavaScript. 

**SCION.NET** provides lightweight bindings to the SCION library for CLR languages (C#, etc.), via [ikvm](http://www.ikvm.net/) and [Rhino](http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/). This allows SCXML to easily be used in .NET development.

For a basic usage example of usage, see [Test.cs](https://github.com/jbeard4/pySCION/blob/master/test/Test.cs)
